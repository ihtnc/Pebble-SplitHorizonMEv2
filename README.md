Pebble-SplitHorizonMEv2
=======================

A Pebble watch face based on the watch face found in http://www.mypebblefaces.com/view?fID=3841&amp;aName=Bonsitm&amp;pageTitle=Split+Horizon%3A+Minutes+Edition&amp;auID=3905.

I Modified the code to move the horizon according to the hour of the day. At 12AM, the horizon is at the lower portion of the screen. Then it
moves up slowly every hour. At 11PM, the horizon should already be at the top portion of the screen. I also added debugging mode for the watch face.
